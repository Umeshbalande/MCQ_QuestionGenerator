# Multiple Choice Question Generator

This repository contains a Python script that generates multiple choice questions. The script uses the OpenAI API to generate the questions, and it can be used to generate questions on any topic.

## Getting Started

To use the script, first install the OpenAI API:


pip install openai
```

Then, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/multiple-choice-question-generator.git
```

Change into the directory of the cloned repository:

```
cd multiple-choice-question-generator
```

Run the script with the following command:

```
python question_generator.py


The script will prompt you for the following information:

* The topic of the questions
* The number of questions to generate
* The difficulty level of the questions

Once you have provided this information, the script will generate the questions and save them to a CSV file.
